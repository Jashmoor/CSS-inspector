# CSS-inspector
A really simple CSS inspector, creates an on-screen list of non user-agent applied CSS styles

Copy the script to your page ( or any page ),
and simply click the element you wish to inspect to bring up a list of all of the user applied styles for the element.

Browser support is limited, and NO default events will fire whilst the script is running
( buttons, links ...etc)
